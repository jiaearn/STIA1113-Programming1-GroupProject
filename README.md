## Introduction:

  This system is purposely designed for the administrator of E-Transport Management System (ETMS) to add and update the details of the lorry. For example, purchase date, plate number, model , tonnage, price, type, registration number and fuel capacity. In order to know the model of the truck that come from which country, I classify the brand such as ISUZU from Japan, HINO from Japan and MAN SE from Germany. Beside that, I had also classify the type of truck into light vehicle for truck which is 1.0 to 2.0 tonnage and heavy vehicle which is 2.1 to 4.5 tonnage. Then, when the lorry is light vehicle, the fuel capacity is 150L and when the lorry is heavy vehicle, the fuel capacity is 200L.\
